and-restaurantfinder
--------------------

Simple application that allows user
to search for a restaurant (optionally by cusisine type)
in their area, and get reviews, map, or call. 

Demonstrates XML parsing, HTTP networking (ultra simple right now, 
plan to update to HttpHelper), Application object, ListView, 
and other basic concepts involved with a multi-activity Android app.

Originally adapted from the Unlocking Android example of the same name
(though modified here in several ways, and used with newer SDKs).
